<h1>Tanki Online Devlog</h1>

<p>Welcome to my devlog for Tanki Online - Remastered! This devlog is my journey of re-making Tanki Online.
 I will be coding, making assets, and modeling everything by myself! I hope you find this entertaining!</p
<br>
<h3>First Devlog</h3>
<br>
<p>I inserted a tank model (Hornet + Railgun) into the workspace inside Unity. I textured it inside Blender.</p>
